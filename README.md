this folder is my attempt to learn RAG and its implementation.

- **custom retriever** : implementeing custom vector index retriever, i.e uses embeddings, vector store and top similarity k method to find semantically similar docs.
- **custom hybrid retriever**: combines both vector index reetriever and keyword retriever, has two modes so we can select if we want intersection or union of results given by both retrievers.
- **rag on md**: its just experiment with my obsidan's daily notes folder.
